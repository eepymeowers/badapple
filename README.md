Bad Apple!! (in python)

made by me and [@aenriii](https://github.com/aenriii) :3

# How to use
You *must* use this under Linux. It does not work properly under Windows due to the console speed. (Even if you have a fast computer!)
It could work under Unix, and likely does work great under anything Unix too, but I haven't tested that.
In order to use this, you need to have playsound installed from pip.
The best way to do this is `pip install playsound`, or `pip3 install playsound`. If you experience a error about possibly breaking system packages, first check if the `python3-playsound` package is available in your package manager.
If it's not, then I believe it is fine to add `--break-system-packages` in this case in order for it to install. It *shouldn't* break anything, but **I am not responsible for any damages you may cause to your system if you do this!! Just because passing that argument worked for me doesn't mean it'll work for you.**

In order to start the program, use `asdasdasdasd.py`. 

# Is it in sync?
I tried to make it in sync, but had to make compromises somewhere. For this project, almost everything is in sync aside from the start when the apple is caught - that part isn't in sync, but the rest of it is almost perfectly in sync, at least as much as I could make it.
